# House-Price-Prediction

This project focuses on predicting house prices using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Feature Engineering, and Machine Learning models. The goal is to analyze various housing attributes, clean and preprocess data, and build an optimized predictive model for accurate price estimation.

Key Steps & Methodology:
âœ” Data Collection & Cleaning â€“ Handled missing values, removed duplicates, and treated outliers for better model performance.
âœ” Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) â€“ Identified trends, correlations, and feature importance using visualization tools (Seaborn, Matplotlib).
âœ” Feature Engineering & Selection â€“ Applied one-hot encoding for categorical data, log transformations for skewed distributions, and selected key features for improved prediction accuracy.
âœ” Model Building & Evaluation â€“ Implemented Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and LightGBM, fine-tuning hyperparameters for optimal performance.
âœ” Performance Metrics & Optimization â€“ Evaluated models using RÂ² Score, RMSE, and MAE, achieving an RMSE of XX and an RÂ² score of YY%.
âœ” Deployment (Optional) â€“ Deployed the best model using Flask / Streamlit for real-time price prediction.
